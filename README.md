## **Project Title: Air Quality Report â€“ Monitoring and Insights for Improved Urban Planning**

### **Description**
This Power BI project provides an interactive and visually rich dashboard to analyze air quality data across various cities. It highlights critical metrics like pollution levels, trends over time, and comparisons of the most and least polluted cities. These insights aim to support urban planning, environmental policymaking, and public health initiatives by identifying patterns and critical areas for intervention.

### **Tech Stack**
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and creating an interactive dashboard.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For calculating averages and trend analyses of pollutants (CO, NO, SO2, PM2.5, etc.).
- **Power Query**: For data cleaning and transformation.

---

### **Power BI Techniques Learned**
1. **Data Import and Preparation**:
   - Imported raw air quality data.
   - Cleaned and transformed the dataset to ensure consistency and accuracy.
   
2. **DAX Functions**:
   - Developed calculated metrics for pollutants (e.g., averages for CO, NO, SO2, and PM2.5) and ranking cities by pollution levels.

3. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - Built dynamic visuals with slicers for filtering by city and pollutant types.

4. **Visualization Techniques**:
   - Bar charts to showcase the top 3 most and least polluted cities.
   - Line chart for air quality trends over time.
   - Geospatial map for area-wise AQI distribution.

5. **KPI Indicators**:
   - Designed KPIs to display average pollutant levels and identify critical thresholds.

### **Key Questions Addressed**
1. **Top and Least Polluted Cities**:
   - Which cities have the highest and lowest pollution levels, and what are the contributing factors?

2. **AQI Trends Over Time**:
   - How has the air quality index (AQI) evolved over the years, and are there significant improvements or deteriorations?

3. **Pollutant Averages**:
   - What are the average levels of key pollutants (CO, NO, SO2, PM2.5) across cities?

4. **Geospatial Overview**:
   - Which regions are most affected by air pollution, and how do they compare?

---

### **Insights and Outcomes**
- **Most Polluted Cities**: Ahmedabad, Delhi, and Patna emerged as cities with the highest pollutant levels.
- **Least Polluted Cities**: Coimbatore, Shillong, and Aizawl had significantly lower pollution levels.
- **Declining AQI Trends**: A general downward trend in AQI over the years suggests improvements in air quality, though hotspots remain.
- **Area-Wise AQI Overview**: The geospatial map highlights regions with high pollutant concentrations, enabling targeted interventions.

### **How to Use**
1. Clone this repository and open the Power BI dashboard file (`Air_Quality_Report.pbix`).
2. Interact with the slicers to filter data by city, pollutants, or years.
3. Explore the visualizations to gain insights into air quality trends and city-wise performance.

---

### **Future Improvements**
- Incorporate real-time air quality monitoring data for up-to-date insights.
- Add additional pollutants like ozone and particulate matter (PM10) for a more comprehensive analysis.
- Enable predictive analysis using machine learning models.
